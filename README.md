# JP_NSX_Powershell
Powershell Module For Managing NSX Via REST Calls.   Significantly faster and more efficient than VMware Provided Power NSX Modules.

A control script has been provided that details example usage.

This module also serves as a great starting point for any REST oriented Powershell modules, and could be repurposed with the calls to NSX being replaced with calls to any REST based endpoint.
